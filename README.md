  # Bankist App #
  
This is an app that I have developed based on a Udemy course entitled "The Complete JavaScript Course". It is a banking app that requires you to login (choose between the four preset accounts) and it displays multiple pieces of information such as the total balance, the current date, the movements, the name or the interest. On the right side there are three options:
- Transfer money - make a deposit to another account
- Request loan - based on a condition, the requested amount is going to be display as a deposit within the movements section
- Close account - delete the account

      Other features
- Every user has a specific locale that is used to personalize the date format, the number format and the currency
- After five minutes the user is logged out
- Date information is included in every movement in the specific format, but for transactions that happened less than 7 days prior to the current date, a message will be displayed ("Today", "Yesterday", "4 days ago" etc)
